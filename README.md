# Building a branched curriculum progression

Starting with 2 stacked classes with about 65% overlap, build a curriculum graph that can accommodate both and include opportunities for individual variation.

## Approach

1. Note that this is an overview course for non-majors, but still engineers. MET and SSE students learning about electricity, circuits, and related topics.  
2. From curriculum paths:
   1. Identify level of general preparation (for effectiveness during progression). 
   2. Establish reasonable expectations (of learning capacity and work ethic).  
   3. Concrete prerequisites (for attachment points and, if necessary, rapid introduction and/or review).  
   4. Select target forward attachment points (for creating a solid basis for follow-on curriculum elements).  
3. Content:
   1. Prerequisites should be independent progressions. These include:  
      1. Prerequisite courses. Should have been covered before the beginning of course, but may need to be incorporated to create contact points.    
      2. Prerequisite topics. Should be covered during course before application.  
   2. Common curriculum should form the backbone of the course.  
   3. Branches should fork off the backbone.  
   4. This is engineering, so:
      1. Study.  
      2. Apply.  
      3. Present.  
      
### Notes on circuits

1. Motivate.  
2. Show examples.  
3. Exercise the ability to identify the function of a circuit from general knowledge and applied analysis.  
4. Exercise the ability to build a circuit given a blueprint.  
5. Exercise the ability to design a circuit given a functional specification.  

### Notes on environment

1. Simulation.  
2. Oscilloscope.
