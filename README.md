# Building a branched curriculum progression

Starting with 2 stacked classes with about 65% overlap, build a curriculum graph that can accommodate both and include opportunities for individual variation.

## Approach

1. Note that this is an overview course for non-majors, but still engineers. MET and SSE students learning about electricity, circuits, and related topics.  
2. From curriculum paths:
   1. Identify level of general preparation (for effectiveness during progression). 
   2. Establish reasonable expectations (of learning capacity and work ethic).  
   3. Concrete prerequisites (for attachment points and, if necessary, rapid introduction and/or review).  
   4. Select target forward attachment points (for creating a solid basis for follow-on curriculum elements).  
3. Content general matter:
   1. Prerequisites should be independent progressions. These include:  
      1. Prerequisite courses. Should have been covered before the beginning of course, but may need to be incorporated to create contact points.    
      2. Prerequisite topics. Should be covered during course before application.  
   2. Common curriculum should from the backbone of the course.  
   3. Branches should fork off the backbone.  
   4. This is engineering, so:
      1. Study.  
      2. Apply.  
      3. Present.  
4. Content merging from syllabi will depend on the conceptual granularity, which has to be decided first!   

## Content 
     
1. Prime STEMGraph with backbone and major branches.  
   1. Recommended texts from syllabi.  
   2. Reasonable other sources.  
2. Mine:
   1. Syllabi & curricula.  
   2. Wikipedia & other online references and encyclopaedias.  
   3. Videos, lectures, books, and courses.  
   4. OER (OpenTextbooks, LibreTexts, etc.).  
3. Build out STEMGraph (TBD). 
   1. This is a **MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ITEM**.
   2. Related to:
      1. Knowledge and Learning Space building.  
      2. Conceptual Change and progression building.  
      3. Cognitive load and efficient mental capacity utilization.  
      4. Conceptual graphs, GNNs, knowledge bases, and the whole knowledge-heavy ML ecosystem.  
   3. Digest the content into concept-level 
   4. _This will be an iterative and continous process!!!_  
   5. Discover and incorporate new sources.  
      
### Notes on circuits

1. Motivate.  
2. Show examples.  
3. Exercise the ability to identify the function of a circuit from general knowledge and applied analysis.  
4. Exercise the ability to build a circuit given a blueprint.  
5. Exercise the ability to design a circuit given a functional specification.  

#### Composition of Apply sections

1. Employing first-look unaided analysis, formulate hypothesis.  
2. Employing a simulator, capture the circuit and test hypothesis. Amend if necessary.  
3. Employing lab kit and measurement equipment (multimeter, function generator, oscilloscope), built circuit and perform definitive analysis.  
4. Based on experience, extend the circuit with a given useful set of features and/or parameters.  
5. Based on the extended experience, design and build an advanced related circuit with a given functional definition.  
6. Employing an exhaustive technical narrative, including visual aids and cited sources, discuss the range of applications. (Wikipedia assignment.)  

### Notes on environment

1. Simulation.  
   1. [NI Multisim](https://www.google.com/search?q=multisim&oq=multisim&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l6j69i65.1688j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8):
      1. Based on original Berkeley SPICE.  
      2. MSUD has license? (**TODO: Ask Kate**)  
2. Oscilloscope.  
   1. Digilent Discovery 
   2. [Instructables DPScope](https://www.instructables.com/DPScope-Build-Your-Own-USBPC-Based-Oscilloscope/).  
   3. Other even simpler.
      1. **TODO:** Compose a multi-part project for the course and weave in with the curriculum!!!
